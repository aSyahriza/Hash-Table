1. Start from your student list program, meaning you need ADD, PRINT, DELETE, and QUIT. 

- Copy from student list

----------------------------
2. Change the way the students are stored; use a hash table.

- Create a class
- Constructor: Takes in length
- Member Function:
  - void insertItem(int x); 
    Insert item into hash table
  - void deleteItem(int key); 
    Delete item from hash table
  - void printList();
    Print item from hash table
  - int hashFunction(int x);
    Hash function 
- Data Member: 
  - Length of table
  - Double node pointers

----------------------------
3. You should create a hash function using the student data which attempts to spread out data evenly through the table. Should start with at least 100 slots

- Hash1: ID % table size

----------------------------
4. It should be able to deal with collisions in a valid way. We will be using chaining, which means each entry is actually a linked list. 

- Each entry entry in table is actual head for linked list

---------------------------- 
5. (10 points) If you get more than 3 collisions when you are chaining (so you add, or would add, a fourth node to a single chain), create a table to have at least double the number of slots, then rehash your students into the new table.  (Your hash should alter based on the size of the table, by the way, and it should spread out the data as you resize the table.  Make it so.)  (10 points)

- Hash 2: Prime - (ID % Prime)
- Ask darren 

---------------------------- 
6. In addition to adding students manually to the hash table, create a random student generator.  You should have a file with a list of first names and a file with a list of last names.  Your student list program should be able to randomly generate new students by grabbing a random student first and last name from the corresponding files, incrementing the id number, adding a random GPA (much like real life), and adding it in.  Make sure you have a command that allows you to specify how many students to generate and add.  This will make debugging your project MUCH easier.
